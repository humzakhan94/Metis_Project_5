Multi-Class Classification and Cluster Analysis

Description: Used data from my father who works at Green Dodge, Kia, Subaru. This data includes all cars sold since 2008.. Used tools such as Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikitlearn to do my analysis.

Features: These included: Postal Code, MSRP, Year, Make, Model, Ext. Warranty Miles, Purchase Date, Sales Type, Purchase Type, Sale Price, Lender. Later created a column called "Model Type" which included van, suv, sedan, etc.

Analysis: Performed a multi-class classification to see which car make will sell. Ran decision tree, KNN, and Naive Bayes models, along with their accuracies, confusion matrix, and Cohen Kappa scores. Naive Bayes had the highest accuracy and Cohen Kappa Score. Also performed a customer cluster analysis (segmentation). Did some K Means clustering and created an Elbow graph to figure out the number of clusters to use. Used PCA to create visualizations in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D. Found that different clusters have different behaviors. Cluster 2 uses finance to buy cars, while cluster 3 uses cash.
